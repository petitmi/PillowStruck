Well you really did it this time
Everyone watched as you took the stars right out of my sky
The light out of my eyesI don′t need a drink or a good conversation
Or the talk of this town all around me
I'm broken, embarrassed, I know there′s nowhere I can go
All I know is that I need space

If it takes a rocket, okay
Somewhere more than a planet away
I wave to the man in the moon
Put a lightyear between me and you
I need space

You really messed with my head
Knocked me off of my axis
I would get out of bed
But around here the fact is
No one who's willing to listen will listen without taking sides of the story
Gravity's holding me here but if I had a say all I′d say
Is that I need space

If it takes a rocket, okay
Somewhere more than a planet away
I wave to the man in the moon
Put a lightyear between me and you
I need space

I wave to the man in the moon
Nowhere to be and nothing to do
With a lightyear between me and you
I need space
I need space
I need space
