Mac-Demarco_Chamber-of-Reflection
Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day you′re born again
Spend some time aloneUnderstand that soon you'll run with better men

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again, alone

No use looking out
It′s within that brings that lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear among the better men

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again, alone

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again, alone
