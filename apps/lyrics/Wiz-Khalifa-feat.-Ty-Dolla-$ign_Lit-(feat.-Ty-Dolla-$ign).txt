We don′t put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Won′t even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire
Won't smoke, won′t pass, won′t hit it if it ain't fireDon′t spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire
We don′t put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Won′t even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire
Won't smoke, won′t pass, won′t hit it if it ain't fire
Don′t spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire

Let′s get to the basics, let's get to the basics
I′m rollin' a J up, I'm lovin′ the fragrance
I′m hardly on time cause my mind is where space is
But I always on grind cause that's how my fam raised me
Think I got problems, say that I′m crazy
Love marijuana, smoke on the daily
Smoke with my mama, roll one for my lady
Blow the whole pound now, came up from an eighty
I'm lettin′ the top down, and countin' them faces
I′m blowin' the smoke out, exhalin' the vapors
I′m smokin′ in public, they stare in amazement
I'm lightin′ that bomb up, it's takin′ me places

We don't put it on in the crib if it ain′t fire
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire
Won′t smoke, won′t pass, won't hit it if it ain′t fire
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain′t fire
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain′t fire
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire
Won′t smoke, won′t pass, won't hit it if it ain′t fire
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain′t fire

I pull up foreign, lil baby for it
I let her drive than it get boring, I lay back smoking (Oh yeah)
Fuck empty windows, fuck empty windows
Girl, first we were just smoking and then we fucking (Lord)
Chop it up, all to the good night
Gotta go get my money right
OG Louis thirteen on me
Don't pass me that mean, homie
Judge gave my nigga life
He took the bitch, still didn′t snitch homie
Niggas put the [?] never been through nothing
Have to keep my distance from them bustas
Fuck her one time, I will never trust her
She got attached to these real lames
Deleting all the texts while I roll a whole...

We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Won′t even pull up to the club in it if it ain′t fire
Won't smoke, won′t pass, won't hit it if it ain′t fire
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain′t fire
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Won′t even pull up to the club in it if it ain′t fire
Won't smoke, won′t pass, won't hit it if it ain′t fire
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain′t fire

Let's go
Let's go
Let′s get it
Haha

Roll up my weed as soon as the day start
Get me a pound and I break it apart
Kush on my clothes, smell the green in my car
Ain′t coming close, you smell me from afar
Time after time, I keep smoking that herb
Joint after joint, I must be on the verge
Of overdosing, I be on that loud
Speeding me up, while I'm slowing you down
I just got back from an overseas trip
Smoking with Dahi, he got me high as shit
Cause we keep nothing but good in our J
Repping our gang and we mob everyday
Break down an ounce, put it right on tray
Ain′t saving nothing, we smoke everything
Light up a joint, let it stink up the place
Or hit the bong, load the smoke in your face

Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high

Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I′m a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high

Break it down and roll another one
I could get anything I want
I told her "You should bring a friend for the crew"
Hear 'em talk but they ain′t want it though
I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke
Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too
Only rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper
Taylor Gang G Pen, smell the vapor
Take it to the head before I walk up to the plane
I′ll probably get so fucking high
Won′t even know my fucking name
You got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow
Never inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke
And I'm never running out of it
Kush smoke, got a lot of it
Smoke like we hit the lottery
Seen Snoop, he was proud of me
Won′t go broke cause I never spend
If them hoes don't smoke, don′t let 'em in

Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I′m a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high

Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high
