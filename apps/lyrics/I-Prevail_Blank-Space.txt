I-Prevail_Blank-Space
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sinSaw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love′s a game, wanna play?
Hey, hey

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let′s be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it′s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it′s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I′m insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

′Cause we're young and we′re reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They′ll tell you I′m insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I′ll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the queen, baby, I′m your king
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
But the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like, "Oh my God
Who is he, who is he?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
′Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it′s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it′s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I′m insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

′Cause we're young and we′re reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They′ll tell you I′m insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I′ll write your name

Girls only want love if it's torture
Don′t say I didn't
Don′t say I didn't warn you

It's torture, it′s torture
Don′t say I didn't warn you
It′s torture, it's torture
Don′t say I didn't warn you

So it′s gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They′ll tell you I′m insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

′Cause we're young and we′re reckless
We'll take this way too far
It′ll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I′ve got a blank space, baby
And I′ll write your name
