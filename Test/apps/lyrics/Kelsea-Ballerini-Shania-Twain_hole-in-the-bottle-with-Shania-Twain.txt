There are many people who drink in moderation
With no problems, social, moral, or medical
They have learned to enjoy liquorWithout letting it upset the functioning of their body and mind
It relaxes you, makes you more congenial (I just had one sip)
This helps a gathering cheerful and friendly

It ain′t my fault
So don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks (ooh)
Ain′t what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishin' on me

There's a hole in the bottle
Leakin′ all this wine
It′s already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don′t miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine (Shania)

I keep my cool
I play by all the rules
Hm, I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
But I won′t cry
About love gone wrong
'Cause tears would water down this ruby red, I′m sippin' on

There's a hole in the bottle (there′s a hole)
Leakin′ all this wine (leakin' all this wine)
It′s already empty and it ain't even suppertime (and it ain′t even supper time)
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There′s a hole in the bottle of wine

Let's go
Alright
Look, it's our perogative
Haha, to have a little fun?
Right?
Right!
Ooh
Just look at that hole in the bottle
Haha
I′m gonna go get us another one
Haha, you go girl

I went and got a new one (new one)
′Cause the other one was broken (oh, broken)
Now this one's halfway gone
And it′s barely even open

There's a hole in the bottle (hole in the bottle)
Leakin′ all this wine (in the bottle)
It's already empty and it ain′t even suppertime (it ain't even suppertime)
Honey, no, I don't miss him (oh, I don′t miss him)
In fact, it slipped my mind
There′s a hole in the bottle of wine (hole in the bottle)

You may ask me where it's goin′
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine
She has abused her system and she′s paying for it
