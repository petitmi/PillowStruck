The-Weeknd-feat.-Daft-Punk_Starboy-(feat.-Daft-Punk)
I′m tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli' point two just to hurt you, ahAll red Lamb′ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you′ve done
I′m a motherfucking starboy

Look what you've done

I′m a motherfucking starboy

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, getting hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don′t really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking ′bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you've done
I′m a motherfucking starboy

Look what you′ve done

I'm a motherfucking starboy

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand-new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash, get me close to God
We don′t pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don′t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you've done

I′m a motherfucking starboy

Look what you've done

I'm a motherfucking starboy

Look what you′ve done

I′m a motherfucking starboy

Look what you've done

I′m a motherfucking starboy
