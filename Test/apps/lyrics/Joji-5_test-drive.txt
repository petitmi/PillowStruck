I'm looking for a long ride

Dying on the west side
(Dying on the west side)

What do you want, babe?
(What do you want, babe?)
I don′t like when you taunt me
(I don't like when you taunt me)
You′ve been calling the wrong name

You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you′ll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you

Dying on the west side
(What do you want, babe?)
I′ll see you in the next life
(Who do you want, babe?)

Waiting on a sacrificial life
Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song, you lied

You gon′ jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won′t matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
