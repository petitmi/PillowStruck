The-Game-Kanye-West_Eazy
(He was once a thug from around the way)
My life was never (Eazy)
My life was never (Eazy)
Started in my Cutlass clutchin′ heat like it's an open oven
Puffin′ chronic, Puff and Biggie out the window, speaker subbin'
Run into the Crips, it ain't no discussion
Bullet wounds drenched in Hennessy and teaspoons of Robitussin
Head up faze, got a few concussion, yeah
Compton′s amazed, Dr. Dre percussion
God, please grant my nigga eternal life, we need the beats
Aftermath where you fall asleep, you do not eat

And my belly is full, gorilla ridin′ the bull
Banana clips in the pool, swan dive in Clase Azul
The opps, I'm on they ass, grandmama whoopings in school
This Wilmington and Brazil where niggas die in they jewels
Too many Problems, too many YGs
So many ties to dollar signs, easy to end up on E
I got shot up like Columbine, the Crips descended on me
Sign my name on the dotted line, that was vengeance on beats
This is the way

(He was once a thug from around the way)
My life was never (Eazy)
My life was never (Eazy)

There it is, there it was
Don′t interrupt just because
It's no love
Shoulder shrug (shrug)

How I ain′t bring nothin' to the table when I′m the table?
I'ma turn up the music, wake up the neighbors
I'ma get that "Thug Life" tatted ′cross the navel
This is how I am in real life, not just on cable
"Mr. Narcissist," tell me ′bout my arrogance
No more counselin', I don′t negotiate with therapists
God Ye, wanna let God in?
But tonight, I guess I'll let my pride win

Cousin Dre sent me scriptures, helped me see life better
Nigga, we havin′ the best divorce ever
If we go to court, we'll go to court together
Matter of fact, pick up your sis, we′ll go to Kourt's together
I watched four kids for like five hours today
I wear these Yeezy boots everywhere, even in the shower today
I got love for the nannies, but real family is better
The cameras watch the kids, y'all stop takin′ the credit

Noncustodial dad, I bought the house next door
What you think the point of really bein′ rich for?
When you give 'em everything, they only want more
Boujee and unruly, y′all need to do some chores
Rich-ass kids, this ain't yo′ mama house
Climb on your brother's shoulders, get that Top Ramen out
God saved me from that crash
Just so I can beat Pete Davidson′s ass (who?)

And my new bitch bad
I know Illuminati mad
This that New-minati, bitch
This that two Bugatti rich
This that "God did this"
Only God did this

There it is, there it was
Don't interrupt, just because
Ain't no love, shoulder shrug
Won′t He do it? Yes He does
Won′t He do it? Yes He does
Won't He do it?

My life was never (Eazy)
This next one gon′ be (Eazy)

(He was once a thug from around the way)
(He was once a thug from around the way, eazy)
(He was-, he was-)
(He was-, he was-)
(He was once a-, once a-)
(Thug from a-, thug from a-, from around the way)
