I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me, and
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansingAnd feel, feel what it′s like to be new

'Cause in my head, there′s a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations
So, they may have a chance of finding a place where
They're far more suited than here

Ba-da ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another′s
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe it′s true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
′Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body

And I do believe it′s true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
′Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
