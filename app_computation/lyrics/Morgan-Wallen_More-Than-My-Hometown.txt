Morgan-Wallen_More-Than-My-Hometown
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town′s rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle downPlant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can′t stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin′ up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain′t twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls ′round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can′t love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can′t change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain′t that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain′t twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
′Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn′t born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin′
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget ′em

′Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin′
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain′t you and me so I guess I'll see you around
′Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more
